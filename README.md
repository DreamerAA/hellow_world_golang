# hellow_world_golang

This repository was created for the purpose of learning golang using СhatGPT 4o.

Artificial intelligence has proposed a set of tasks that will be solved using the golang language in this repository.

1. A simple program "Hello, World"
Task: Start with the simplest one — write a program that outputs "Hello, World!". This will allow you to install Go, configure the development environment and run the first program.
2. Reading and writing files
Task: Write a program that reads a text file and displays its contents on the screen. Then modify it so that you write the information to a new file. In the process, you will learn how to work with the os package and the functions for reading and writing files.
3. Working with JSON
Task: Implement a program that accepts a JSON file with data (for example, a list of users) and outputs its contents in a human-readable format. This will introduce you to the encoding/json package for working with JSON in Go.
4. Competitive data processing using goroutin
Task: Write a program that downloads data from multiple URLs at the same time using goroutines. This exercise will help you understand how to work with competition and synchronization through channels.
5. Web server
Task: Create a simple web server using the net/http package that responds to "Hello, World!" requests or returns data via the API. This will help you master the basics of web development in Go, learn how to work with HTTP requests and responses.
6. Command Line Parser
Task: Write a program that accepts command-line arguments (for example, like ls or cat in Unix). You can implement a utility to list files in a directory or convert text from one format to another.
7. Simple cache based on interfaces
Task: Implement a caching mechanism using Go interfaces. This task will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of how interfaces work and how polymorphism can be used in Go.
8. Todo list using a database
Task: Create a console application for managing tasks with the ability to save them in an SQLite or PostgreSQL database via the database/sql package. This will help you understand the basics of working with SQL databases through Go.
9. Testing and benchmarks
Task: Write some simple functions and write tests for them using the built-in testing package. This exercise will help you master working with unit tests and performance profiling (benchmarking).
10. Generating random passwords
Task: Write a program to generate random passwords with a choice of length and complexity (including special characters, numbers, etc.). This task will teach you how to work with the math/rand package and give you the opportunity to practice with cyclic constructions and string processing.
11. Working with Goroutines and Channels
Task: Write a program that creates several goroutines, each of which processes its own set of data, and use channels to transfer the results back to the main program. This will deepen your understanding of competitive programming in Go.
12. Creating a REST API
Task: Implement a simple REST API for working with entities (for example, tasks, users, books, etc.) with the ability to add, modify, delete and retrieve data. You can use popular frameworks like Gin or Echo, or a standard library.
13. Data pipeline with goroutines
Task: Create a data processing system using a pipeline, where each stage of data processing is a separate mountain, and channels connect these stages. For example, you can implement a pipeline to read data from a file, filter the data, and display it on the screen.
14. Report Generator
Task: Implement a program that generates a report on data (for example, sales, users, or events), collecting data from various sources and processing them. This will allow you to work with text files, formatting strings and data structures.
15. Application for working with caches
Task: Implement a cache with the possibility of limited data storage (for example, by the number of elements or by lifetime) and study the concepts of eviction policies (LRU, LFU, etc.).
